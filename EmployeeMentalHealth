--Answer: People are almost twice as likely to seek mental health treatment if their employer provides mental health benefits. 
--Since 36% of employees reported that their mental health interferes with their work, it's important to provide mental health benefits so employees get treatment.

COUNT(*)*100/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo].[JobMentalHealth]) AS Percentage_of_Employees
FROM [dbo].[JobMentalHealth]
GROUP BY phys_health_consequence, mental_health_consequence
ORDER BY 3 DESC
--Fourth highest percentage is employees who think there will be no consequences disclosing physical health issues, but there would be consequences if they disclose mental health issues
